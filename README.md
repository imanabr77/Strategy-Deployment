# Strategy-Deployment

Canary deployment is a software deployment strategy that gradually rolls out new versions of an application to a small subset of users before fully releasing it to everyone.

### What is a Canary Deployment?

* It involves deploying a new version of an application alongside the existing one.
* A small percentage of traffic is routed to the new version while the rest continues on the old version.
* This allows testing the new version in a production-like environment with real users.
